      <description>How can EnzymeML help you to manage your experimental data?
EnzymeML was developed to support data acquisition, data analysis, and sharing of data by providing a standardized exchange format for enzymatic data. EnzymeML follows the Standards of Reporting Enzymology Data (STRENDA) Guidelines, a comprehensive set of metadata describing reaction conditions and kinetic models. EnzymeML is written in eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
It builds on the well-established Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and includes information about the enzyme, the substrate(s) and product(s), the reaction conditions, the selected kinetic model, and estimated kinetic parameters.</description>

      <description>How can EnzymeML help you developing, implementing and analysing models?
An EnzymeML document provides the complete experimental information including the enzyme concentration, the initial concentrations of substrates, products, or inhibitors, and the measured concentrations of substrate or product at different time points. It might also provide a preferred kinetic model or alternative kinetic models. The model consists of a kinetic law which determines the temporal changes in the concentration of substrates, products, or enzyme as a function of measured concentrations of substrates, products, and enzyme, and of kinetic parameters.</description>

      <description>How can EnzymeML help you to publish results and to exchange data?
EnzymeML is a flexible data model for biocatalysis and enzymology capable to completely describe an experiment in a machine-readable format. In order to handle and integrate EnzymeML in your database, we provide our software solution PyEnzyme, which can be either installed locally or reached via several endpoints of our REST-API.
Currently implemented functionalities Validation of minimal requirements and upload to SABIO-RK PyEnzyme as well as our REST-API provide an interface to validate incoming EnzymeML documents to comply with the minimal requirements necessary for a succesful upload to your database.</description>

      <description>How can you contribute to EnzymeML?   More applications which read and write EnzymeML
As a standardized exchange format for enzymatic data, EnzymeML offers the opportunity to exchange data between different applications without need of reformatting. We currently collaborate with software developers and database providers to enable their applications to read and write EnzymeML (find technical details here).
  Extension of the data model
Currently, an EnzymeML document contains information about reaction conditions (temperature, buffer, additives) and about the enzyme, the substrates, and the products.</description>
