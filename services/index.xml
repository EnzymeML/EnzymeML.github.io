      <description>How can EnzymeML help you to manage your experimental data?
Read about use a case study in biocatalysis and enzymology.
Editing of EnzymeML: simulation of time course data from kinetic parameters We artificially created a time course data using entry KJWIQY from the STRENDA DB. The time course was simulated at different initial concentrations in the range of 25.0 to 500.0 Î¼M as noted in the STRENDA DB entry. It should be noted that each different concentration was created as a duplicate species entry with varying initial concentration and identified by a suffix in the name (e.</description>

      <description>Looking for software and databases that read and write EnzymeML?
Here we present you one example to inspire your team.
Kinetic modeling of EnzymeML data with COPASI You can analyze and model time course enzyme kinetic data stored in EnzymeML with the biochemical systems simulator COPASI. The integration can be done using the PyEnzyme library and a COPASI-specific thin API layer (TL_COPASI). Once you are in COPASI, you can employ different kinetic laws to estimate kinetic parameters and test reaction mechanisms, and plot your results.</description>

      <description>Want to implement EnzymeML read and write functionalities in your software or database?
Here we present you one example to inspire your team.
Uploading EnzymeML documents to SABIO-RK SABIO-RK is a curated database that contains information about biochemical reactions, their kinetic rate equations with parameters, and experimental conditions. YOu can use an EnzymeML parsers, JEnzyme or PyEnzyme, to read in EnzymeML documents and to create a new SABIO-RK entry. Once the entry is created, SABIO-RK curators check the created entry before it is posted to the public SABIO-RK database.</description>
