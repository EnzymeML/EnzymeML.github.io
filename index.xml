      <description>The EnzymeML specifications define the syntax and semantics of EnzymeML. These documents are the definitive references for EnzymeML.
STRENDA Guidelines EnzymeML helps you to implement the STRENDA Guidelines. These guidelines aim to support authors to comprehensively report kinetic and equilibrium data from their investigations of enzyme activities.
Structure of EnzymeML document An EnzymeML document consists of three file types: a file using SBML to describe the experimental reaction conditions, the kinetic model, and the kinetic parameters, CSV (comma-separated values)-formatted files to store the time courses of substrate and product concentrations, and a manifest file lists the content of the document.</description>

      <title>For experimentalists</title>

      <description>How can EnzymeML help you to manage your experimental data?
Managing experimental data with EnzymeML   Measured time course data on substrate and/or product concentrations is saved in the same document with metadata about the enzyme and the reaction conditions. This faciliates replicability and reproducibility of experimental assays.
  EnzymeML documents are standardized, so their format is independent of the experimental scientist. Documents are machine- and human-readable. Markup languanges (ML) are specifically designed for machines, and therefore they are not optimally for user reading.</description>

      <description>An application programming interface (API) which consists of two libraries, the Python library PyEnzyme, and the Java library JEnzyme, which support reading, writing, editing, merging, and visualization of EnzymeML documents.
API description The API uses the SBML syntax and naming conventions which are familiar to enzymologists to be implemented into EnzymeML. The basic concept of the two libraries is the usage of multiple dictionaries, in which proteins, reactants, units, and reactions are stored.</description>

      <description>How can EnzymeML help you developing, implementing and analysing models? Here we present you one example to illustrate the power of EnzymeML for modelers.
Kinetic modeling of EnzymeML data with COPASI Experimental data on enzyme kinetics (reaction conditions, enzyme concentration, time course of substrate and product concentrations) is stored in a single EnzymeML document and can uploaded to the biochemical system simulator COPASI. Within COPASI, different reaction mechanisms can be tested by selecting different kinetic laws and estimating kinetic parameters.</description>

      <description>To illustrate the power of EnzymeML, we illustrate selected applications for experimental enzymologists, system biology modelers, and software developers. More applications are available in our EnzymeML preprint, which can be downloaded in our Publications page.
Creating EnzymeML documents from spreadsheets In the absence of a standard format, experimentalists typically store their experimental time course data in a spreadsheet following an ad hoc structure. Recently, a CSV-formatted spreadsheet, the BioCatNet template, was proposed to store and report experimental data on enzyme-catalyzed reactions according to the STRENDA Guidelines.</description>

      <description>Want to implement EnzymeML read and write functionalities in your database? Here you have somes ideas to inspire your team.
EnzymeML is compatible with SMBL EnzymeML is an extension of SBML. All additional information that are specific to enzyme-catalyzed are added as annotation in a standard SBML file. Thus, EnzymeML is compatible with SBML.
Application Programming Interface (API) We created an Application Programming Interface (API) to interface with two database applications: STRENDA DB and SABIO-RK.</description>

      <description>The EnzymeML Software and Database Guide provides a summary of all EnzymeML-compatible software systems and databases currently available.
COPASI COPASI is a software application for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks and their dynamics. COPASI is a stand-alone program that supports models in the SBML standard and can simulate their behavior using ODEs or Gillespie&amp;rsquo;s stochastic simulation algorithm; arbitrary discrete events can be included in such simulations. COPASI is a versatile with powerful features for representing enzyme models, simulation, and data analysis, visulaization and output.</description>
