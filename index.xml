      <description>PyEnzyme is a comprehensive software solution for manipulating EnzymeML files. Furthermore, the library incorporates convenient access to prominent modeling platforms, such as COPASI and PySCeS, enabling a smooth progression from laboratory experiments to kinetic characterization. Additionally, PyEnzyme empowers users to generate aesthetically appealing, publication-quality visualizations, as well as export data to widely utilized formats, such as CSV and JSON.
The API uses the SBML syntax and naming conventions which are familiar to enzymologists to be implemented into EnzymeML.</description>

      <description>The EnzymeML specifications define the syntax and semantics of EnzymeML. These documents are the definitive references for EnzymeML.
STRENDA Guidelines EnzymeML helps you to implement the STRENDA Guidelines. These guidelines aim to support authors in comprehensively reporting kinetic and equilibrium data from their investigations of enzyme activities.
Structure of EnzymeML document An EnzymeML document consists of three file types: a file using SBML to describe the experimental reaction conditions, the kinetic model, and the kinetic parameters, CSV (comma-separated values)-formatted files to store the time courses of substrate and product concentrations, and a manifest file lists the content of the document.</description>

      <description>This document will further explain the workflow and how to use the spreadsheet by giving best practices. For this, the next paragraph will further elucidate how to acquire the template, how to fill in data and finally how to convert it to EnzymeML.
1. Download the EnzymeML template The EnzymeML template can be downloaded here. Additionally, an example template is provided which demonstrates how a template should be filled.
Once downloaded, you can open the template with any commonly available spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel™ or OpenOffice Calc.</description>

      <description>How can EnzymeML help you to manage your experimental data? EnzymeML was developed to support data acquisition, data analysis, and sharing of data by providing a standardized exchange format for enzymatic data. EnzymeML follows the Standards of Reporting Enzymology Data (STRENDA) Guidelines, a comprehensive set of metadata describing reaction conditions and kinetic models. EnzymeML is written in eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
It builds on the well-established Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and includes information about the enzyme, the substrate(s) and product(s), the reaction conditions, the selected kinetic model, and estimated kinetic parameters.</description>

      <description>We understand the significance of embracing a language-independent methodology for data retrieval and parsing in the present interconnected application ecosystem. In light of this, we have made accessible a publicly available REST-API that incorporates a comprehensive array of endpoints, providing comprehensive EnzymeML handling capabilities. This API allows you to integrate PyEnzyme into your web-based toolkit, regardless of your technology stack, thereby granting you access to all the benefits of PyEnzyme without the need to program in Python.</description>

      <guid>http://EnzymeML.org/services/modelers/</guid>
      <description>How can EnzymeML help you develop, implement and analyze models? An EnzymeML document provides the complete experimental information including the enzyme concentration, the initial concentrations of substrates, products, or inhibitors, and the measured concentrations of substrate or product at different time points. It might also provide a preferred kinetic model or alternative kinetic models. The model consists of a kinetic law that determines the temporal changes in the concentration of substrates, products, or enzymes as a function of measured concentrations of substrates, products, and enzymes, and kinetic parameters.</description>

      <description>To illustrate the power of EnzymeML, we illustrate selected applications for experimental enzymologists, system biology modelers, and software developers. More applications and use cases are available in our publications on EnzymeML.
Creating EnzymeML documents from spreadsheets In the absence of a standard format, experimentalists typically store their experimental time course data in a spreadsheet following an ad hoc structure. Recently, a CSV-formatted spreadsheet, the BioCatNet template, was proposed to store and report experimental data on enzyme-catalyzed reactions according to the STRENDA Guidelines.</description>

      <description>How can EnzymeML help you to publish results and to exchange data? EnzymeML is a flexible data model for biocatalysis and enzymology capable of completely describing an experiment in a machine-readable format. To handle and integrate EnzymeML in your database, we provide our software solution PyEnzyme, which can be either installed locally or reached via several endpoints of our REST-API.
Validation of minimal requirements and upload to SABIO-RK PyEnzyme as well as our REST-API provide an interface to validate incoming EnzymeML documents to comply with the minimum requirements necessary for a successful upload to your database.</description>

      <description>An application programming interface (API) that consists of two libraries, the Python library PyEnzyme, and the REST-API, which support reading, writing, editing, merging, and visualization of EnzymeML documents.
API description The API uses the SBML syntax and naming conventions which are familiar to enzymologists to be implemented into EnzymeML. The basic concept of the two libraries is the usage of multiple dictionaries, in which proteins, reactants, units, and reactions are stored.</description>

      <description>The EnzymeML Software and Database Guide provides a summary of all EnzymeML-compatible software systems and databases currently available.
COPASI COPASI is a software application for the simulation and analysis of biochemical networks and their dynamics. COPASI is a stand-alone program that supports models in the SBML standard and can simulate their behavior using ODEs or Gillespie&amp;rsquo;s stochastic simulation algorithm; arbitrary discrete events can be included in such simulations. COPASI is versatile with powerful features for representing enzyme models, simulation, data analysis, visualization and output.</description>
