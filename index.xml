      <description>The EnzymeML specifications define the syntax and semantics of EnzymeML. These documents are the definitive references for EnzymeML.
STRENDA Guidelines EnzymeML helps you to implement the STRENDA Guidelines. These guidelines aim to support authors to comprehensively report kinetic and equilibrium data from their investigations of enzyme activities.
Structure of EnzymeML document An EnzymeML document consists of three file types: a file using SBML to describe the experimental reaction conditions, the kinetic model, and the kinetic parameters, CSV (comma-separated values)-formatted files to store the time courses of substrate and product concentrations, and a manifest file lists the content of the document.</description>

      <description>How can EnzymeML help you to manage your experimental data?
EnzymeML was developed to support data acquisition, data analysis, and sharing of data by providing a standardized exchange format for enzymatic data. EnzymeML follows the Standards of Reporting Enzymology Data (STRENDA) Guidelines, a comprehensive set of metadata describing reaction conditions and kinetic models. EnzymeML is written in eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
It builds on the well-established Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and includes information about the enzyme, the substrate(s) and product(s), the reaction conditions, the selected kinetic model, and estimated kinetic parameters.</description>

      <description>An application programming interface (API) which consists of two libraries, the Python library PyEnzyme, and the Java library JEnzyme, which support reading, writing, editing, merging, and visualization of EnzymeML documents.
API description The API uses the SBML syntax and naming conventions which are familiar to enzymologists to be implemented into EnzymeML. The basic concept of the two libraries is the usage of multiple dictionaries, in which proteins, reactants, units, and reactions are stored.</description>

      <description>How can EnzymeML help you developing, implementing and analysing models?
An EnzymeML document provides the complete experimental information including the enzyme concentration, the initial concentrations of substrates, products, or inhibitors, and the measured concentrations of substrate or product at different time points. It might also provide a preferred kinetic model or alternative kinetic models. The model consists of a kinetic law which determines the temporal changes in the concentration of substrates, products, or enzyme as a function of measured concentrations of substrates, products, and enzyme, and of kinetic parameters.</description>

      <description>To illustrate the power of EnzymeML, we illustrate selected applications for experimental enzymologists, system biology modelers, and software developers. More applications are available in our EnzymeML preprint, which can be downloaded in our Publications page.
Creating EnzymeML documents from spreadsheets In the absence of a standard format, experimentalists typically store their experimental time course data in a spreadsheet following an ad hoc structure. Recently, a CSV-formatted spreadsheet, the BioCatNet template, was proposed to store and report experimental data on enzyme-catalyzed reactions according to the STRENDA Guidelines.</description>

      <description>How can EnzymeML help you to publish results and to exchange data?
EnzymeML is a flexible data model for biocatalysis and enzymology capable to completely describe an experiment in a machine-readable format. In order to handle and integrate EnzymeML in your database, we provide our software solution PyEnzyme, which can be either installed locally or reached via several endpoints of our REST-API.
Currently implemented functionalities Validation of minimal requirements and upload to SABIO-RK PyEnzyme as well as our REST-API provide an interface to validate incoming EnzymeML documents to comply with the minimal requirements necessary for a succesful upload to your database.</description>

      <description>How can you contribute to EnzymeML?   More applications which read and write EnzymeML
As a standardized exchange format for enzymatic data, EnzymeML offers the opportunity to exchange data between different applications without need of reformatting. We currently collaborate with software developers and database providers to enable their applications to read and write EnzymeML (find technical details here).
  Extension of the data model
Currently, an EnzymeML document contains information about reaction conditions (temperature, buffer, additives) and about the enzyme, the substrates, and the products.</description>

      <description>The EnzymeML Software and Database Guide provides a summary of all EnzymeML-compatible software systems and databases currently available.
COPASI COPASI is a software application for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks and their dynamics. COPASI is a stand-alone program that supports models in the SBML standard and can simulate their behavior using ODEs or Gillespie&amp;rsquo;s stochastic simulation algorithm; arbitrary discrete events can be included in such simulations. COPASI is a versatile with powerful features for representing enzyme models, simulation, and data analysis, visulaization and output.</description>
